# Numerical Methods Problem Sets

## Introduction

Welcome to the Numerical Methods Problem Sets repository. This repository contains my solutions and notes for the problem sets assigned in my Numerical Methods course at FGV EPGE on the Summer of 2024. The goal of this repository is not only to track my own learning progress but also to provide a resource for others studying numerical methods.

Numerical Methods is a branch of mathematics that provides techniques for solving mathematical problems numerically, i.e., by numerical calculations. The course material can be seen at https://epge.fgv.br/we/MD/MetodosNumericos/2024 (Portuguese).

Codes mainly written in Julia.
