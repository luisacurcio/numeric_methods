# Numerical Methods Problem Sets

## Introduction

Welcome to the Numerical Methods Problem Sets repository. This repository contains my codes for the problem sets assigned in my Numerical Methods course at FGV EPGE, tought by Professor CÃ©zar Santor on the Summer of 2024. The goal of this repository is not only to track my own learning progress but also to provide a resource for others studying numerical methods.

Numerical Methods is a branch of mathematics that provides techniques for solving mathematical problems numerically, i.e., by numerical calculations. The course material can be seen at https://epge.fgv.br/we/MD/MetodosNumericos/2024 (Portuguese and English).

Codes are mainly written in Julia and may contain errors. 

## Problem Set 1:
Discretization and estimation of an AR1 process using Tauchen's and Rouwenhorst's methods.

## Problem Set 2: 
Value function iteration techniques exploring monotonicity, concavity, monotonicity + concavity, building an accelerator, multigrid method and endogenous grid method.

## Problem Set 3: 
Projection methods: global projection method (Chebyshev polynomials and collocation points method) and finite elements method (using both collocation and Garlerkin methods).

## Probelm Set 4: 
Numerically solve a heterogeneous-agent economy.
